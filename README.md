## Project Title: Efficiency

### What and why?
This application is a one-stop-shop for student origanizational needs, that allows a user to embed custom websites into this application to localize all their important applications. By default it should include an embed of a student's email and calendar, a to-do checklist that is user customizable and alerts to notify the user of their upcoming deadlines. I find that as a college student, there's so many different websites and chat groups that I have to keep track of, so it would be really nice to have everything localized in one place. 

### For whom?
This application would be for students and while I would have intended for this to be for NYU students originally, if the product ends up begin as customizable as I'd imagine, I don't see why it couldn't extend to other students from other schools.

### How?
The default page would simply have the user's Gmail and Calendar as embeded widgets (probably similar to how these applications would look on a phone). The user can view their upcoming events or mail in one place. They can also add new tabs in this application to add more embeded websites, such as a Slack groupchat for example by clicking a button and pasting a link. Later on, clicking that tab will simply open up either that link or an embed of that page. The user can also add things to a checklist in another tab which the application will notify them to complete when the time comes.

### Scope
It shouldn't be too simple because it involves embeding from other websites and also has enough different parts to warrant a team of 4-6 people. There would also be the problem of dealing with security for the different websites that the user wants to embed because (presumably) most of the sites that are of use to the user would need a username and password.
